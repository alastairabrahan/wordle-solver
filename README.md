# wordle-solver by Alastair Abrahan

Run the python program to solve a tough Wordle problem.

1) The program recommends a list of words for your first Wordle guess.

2) The program asks which word you selected for your first guess.

3) The program asks how each letter from your first word performed.

4) The program recommends a new list of words for your next guess.

5) The program asks if you still need help. If yes, the program will continue and repeat steps 2-5 with the next word until you solve the Wordle problem; if no, the program will end.
